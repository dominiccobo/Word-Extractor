# Word Extractor

Extracts contents of a word document to an easily browsed folder. Useful for people who don't only just use Windows and
require a way to circumvent the single-mindedness of people circulating documents with embedded files / archives etc.

### Disclaimer

I put this together in less than 20 minutes to circumvent an issue with my University's content not allowing me to use
my own Linux desktop or Mac laptop without having to startup  Windows VM. It has not been thoroughly tested, and may
not work with everything, but is a proof of concept that worked for what I needed; adapt as you must.
